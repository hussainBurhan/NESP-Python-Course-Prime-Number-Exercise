Prime Number Checker:
This Python program determines whether a given input is a prime number or not. 
It prompts the user to enter a number and then checks if it is greater than 1. 
If so, it iterates through a range of numbers from 2 to the given number, checking for any factors. 
If a factor is found, it prints a message indicating that the number is not prime, along with the factorization details. 
Otherwise, it confirms that the number is prime. 
If the input is less than or equal to 1, it immediately informs the user that it is not a prime number.

Usage:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter a number when prompted.
3. The program will output whether the number is prime or not.

Example:
Enter a number to find out if it is a prime number or not: 17
17 is a prime number
